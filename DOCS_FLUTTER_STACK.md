# Toolchain and commands — OfficeToolCombo

**Canonical source for every command an agent or a human runs in this repository.** When a skill, a standard or a guide disagrees with this file, this file wins — it accounts for this project's workspace layout, flavors and flags.

Keep it accurate. A stale command here produces confidently wrong verification claims everywhere else.

## Pinned toolchain

| Tool | Version | Pinned where |
|------|---------|--------------|
| Flutter | `3.44.8` | this file + CI + `REPLACE:FLUTTER_VERSION_FILE` |
| Dart | `3.12.2` | bundled with Flutter |
| Channel | `REPLACE:FLUTTER_CHANNEL` | |
| JDK | `REPLACE:JDK_VERSION` | Android builds |
| Xcode | `REPLACE:XCODE_VERSION` | iOS builds |
| CocoaPods | `REPLACE:COCOAPODS_VERSION` | iOS builds |

**CI uses the same versions.** Drift between CI and local is the most common source of unreproducible failures.

## Verification chain

Run in this order. Each must be clean before the next means anything.

| # | Purpose | Command | Pass condition |
|---|---------|---------|----------------|
| 1 | Format | `dart format --set-exit-if-changed .` | exit 0 |
| 2 | Analyze | `REPLACE:FLUTTER_ANALYZE_CMD` | **0 issues** |
| 3 | Codegen currency | `REPLACE:FLUTTER_CODEGEN_CMD` then `git diff --exit-code` | no diff |
| 4 | Tests | `REPLACE:FLUTTER_TEST_CMD` | 0 failures, 0 unexpected skips |
| 5 | Coverage | `REPLACE:FLUTTER_COVERAGE_CMD` | ≥ `80`% and not decreasing |

---

## Development

| Purpose | Command |
|---------|---------|
| Fetch dependencies | `REPLACE:FLUTTER_PUBGET_CMD` |
| Run (dev flavor) | `REPLACE:FLUTTER_RUN_DEV_CMD` |
| Run (staging) | `REPLACE:FLUTTER_RUN_STAGING_CMD` |
| Codegen watch | `REPLACE:FLUTTER_CODEGEN_WATCH_CMD` |
| Regenerate localisations | `REPLACE:FLUTTER_L10N_CMD` |
| List devices | `flutter devices` |

---

## Tests

| Purpose | Command |
|---------|---------|
| All | `REPLACE:FLUTTER_TEST_CMD` |
| One file | `flutter test <path>` |
| Coverage report | `REPLACE:FLUTTER_COVERAGE_CMD` |
| Update goldens (**review every diff**) | `REPLACE:FLUTTER_GOLDEN_UPDATE_CMD` |
| Integration | `REPLACE:FLUTTER_INTEGRATION_CMD` |

Golden platform of record: `REPLACE:GOLDEN_PLATFORM`. Goldens generated elsewhere will fail — font rasterisation differs by OS.

---

## Builds

| Target | Command |
|--------|---------|
| Android bundle | `REPLACE:FLUTTER_BUILD_AAB_CMD` |
| Android APKs | `REPLACE:FLUTTER_BUILD_APK_CMD` |
| iOS | `REPLACE:FLUTTER_BUILD_IOS_CMD` |
| Web | `REPLACE:FLUTTER_BUILD_WEB_CMD` |

Release builds always carry `--obfuscate --split-debug-info=REPLACE:SYMBOLS_DIR`. **Symbols are archived per release and uploaded to the crash reporter**, or every crash report is unreadable.

---

## Performance

| Purpose | Command |
|---------|---------|
| Profile run | `flutter run --profile -d <device>` |
| Startup trace | `flutter run --profile --trace-startup -d <device>` |
| Size analysis | `flutter build REPLACE:PRIMARY_TARGET --analyze-size` |
| DevTools | `dart devtools` |

Reference device: `REPLACE:REFERENCE_DEVICE_LOW`. Every performance number is reported with device, OS, build mode, Flutter version and run count.

---

## Flavors

| Flavor | Entry point | Application id | Backend |
|--------|-------------|----------------|---------|
| dev | `REPLACE:DEV_ENTRYPOINT` | `REPLACE:DEV_APP_ID` | `REPLACE:DEV_BACKEND` |
| staging | `REPLACE:STAGING_ENTRYPOINT` | `REPLACE:STAGING_APP_ID` | `REPLACE:STAGING_BACKEND` |
| prod | `REPLACE:PROD_ENTRYPOINT` | `REPLACE:PROD_APP_ID` | `REPLACE:PROD_BACKEND` |

---

## Troubleshooting

Route toolchain failures to `@flutter-doctor diagnose`. **Do not start with `flutter clean`** — it destroys the evidence that identifies the cause and usually does not help.
